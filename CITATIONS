The core of the program has been described in two articles focusing on the atomic and diatomic parts, respectively:

S. Lehtola, Fully numerical Hartree‐Fock and density functional calculations. I. Atoms. Int. J. Quantum Chem. 2019, e25945. doi:10.1002/qua.25945. arXiv:1810.11651

S. Lehtola, Fully numerical Hartree‐Fock and density functional calculations. II. Diatomic molecules. Int. J. Quantum Chem. 2019, e25944. doi:10.1002/qua.25944. arXiv:1810.11653

Calculations in finite magnetic fields have been described in:

S. Lehtola, M. Dimitrova, and D. Sundholm, Fully numerical electronic structure calculations on diatomic molecules in weak to strong magnetic fields, Mol. Phys. (2019), DOI: 10.1080/00268976.2019.1597989. arXiv:1812.06274

There is also a review paper discussing fully numerical calculations on atoms and diatomic molecules in general:

S. Lehtola, A review on non-relativistic fully numerical electronic structure calculations on atoms and diatomic molecules, Int. J. Quantum Chem. 2019, e25968. doi:10.1002/qua.25968. arXiv:1902.01431

The diatomic program relies on a library for the calculation of Legendre functions that has been described in

B. Schneider et al, Comput. Phys. Commun. 2010, 181, 2091–2097;
B. Schneider et al, Comput. Phys. Commun. 2018, 225, 192–193.

Density functionals are evaluated in both the atomic and diatomic program with the libxc library, which has been described in

S. Lehtola et al, SoftwareX 2018, 7, 1–5.
